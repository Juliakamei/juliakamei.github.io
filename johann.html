 <p>Jacob Bernoulli’s younger brother was Johann Bernoulli. He was a brilliant
mathematician who made significant contributions to the field of calculus. Johann’s
father, Nicholas, once again provided him with a well-rounded education.
that he might one day join the family business Johann, on the other hand, had no
desire to work in the spice trade and enrolled in the University of Basel to study
medicine in 1683. He requested that his brother, Jacob, teach him mathematics.
Jacob, who was twelve years Johann’s senior, was a mathematics professor
at the University of Basel at the time. Johann studied Leibniz’s calculus papers
with Jacob’s assistance until he became proficient, and his mathematical
prowess soon matched that of his brother.</p>
<p>Calculus was a difficult subject to grasp at the time. The Bernoulli brothers
were among the few European mathematicians who understood calculus. Jacob
had no trouble teaching his younger brother at first. He recognised his
brother’s mathematical abilities and offered to work with Johann. However, the
two brothers’ collaboration quickly devolved into heated arguments. Johann’s
ego grew larger as time passed. He began to boast about his accomplishments
while disparaging his brother. Jacob was so enraged that he made crude remarks
about Johann’s abilities, referring to him as a student who simply repeated what
the teacher taught him, a parrot. Jacob and Johann exchanged insulting comments
about each other in the academic community, earning them a notorious
reputation for their family unity.</p>
<p>Johann was a brilliant mathematician despite his family problems. Johann was
possibly a more productive scientist than Jacob. He studied differential equation
theory and discovered fundamental principles of mechanics and optical laws. He
used calculus to solve problems concerning Newton’s laws of gravitation that
Newton had failed to solve. Johann also contributed significantly to the study
of the equation: $$ y= x^x $$</p>
<p>He discovered the Bernoulli series and made advances in navigation theory and
ship sailing. He is also famous for his incredible letter writing (over 2500 messages)
and tutoring of another great mathematician, Leonhard Euler.</p>
<p>Johann proposed the brachistrochrone problem, which is the fastest descent
curve of a particle sliding from one point to another under the influence of gravity.
Johann challenged the "savviest mathematicians from all over the world" to
solve the problem in six months. There were five correct answers. Four of these
came from well-known mathematicians, including L’Hôpital, Leibniz, Jacob, and
Johann himself, and one from an anonymous mathematician. However, based
on the method used to solve the problem, experts recognised that the anonymous
solver was none other than Sir Isaac Newton, and Johann commented on
it "Ex ungue Leonem" (Tell a lion by its claw). Newton later admitted that he
solved the problem by obsessively thinking about it for 12 hours. The solution
to this problem is an inverted cycloid fragment. A cycloid is the curve traced
by a fixed point on the perimeter of a straight-line-rolling wheel.</p>
<p>Johann’s solution to the brachistochrone problem was revolutionary in that it
laid the groundwork for a new branch of calculus known as calculus of variations.
Calculus of variations, a generalisation of calculus, deals with extremizing
functionals as opposed to functions in ordinary calculus. Huygens discovered
in 1673, twenty-three years after the brachistotone problem, that the cycloid
is also the solution to the "tautochrone problem." The "tautochrone problem"
requires finding a curve that allows a particle moving under gravity to reach a
given point on the curve in equal time regardless of its initial position on the
curve.</p>
<p>Knowing that the cycloid solves both the "brachistotone problem" and the "tautochrone
problem," Johann was moved to write: "But you will be petrified with
astonishment when I say that exactly this same cycloid, the tautochrone of Huygens,
is the brachistotone we are seeking."</p> <center><p><font size="3"><a href="daniel.html">Daniel I Bernoulli</a></font></p></center>
