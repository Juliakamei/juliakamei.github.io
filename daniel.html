<center><h1> <font size="+2"> Daniel I Bernoulli (1700-1782)</font></h1></center>

 <p>Johann Bernoulli’s second son was Daniel Bernoulli. On February 8, 1700, he
was born in Groningen, Netherlands. Johann Bernoulli, like his father, did not
want his son to pursue a career in mathematics. Johann Bernoulli attempted to
persuade Daniel that mathematics is unprofitable and attempted to place Daniel
in an apprenticeship with a merchant, but Daniel refused. Daniel began studying
logic and philosophy at the University of Basel when he was thirteen, and he
graduated two years later with a bachelor’s degree. Bernoulli went to Venice to
practise medicine in the early 1720s. He also planned to continue his studies at
the University of Padua, but he became too ill to do so. Instead, he concentrated
on mathematics, publishing his first book, "Mathematical Exercises," in 1724.
Bernoulli also designed an hourglass for use at sea within a year. The sand
trickle had to be consistent, no matter how violently the ship moved, even in a
storm. At the age of twenty-five, he entered this work in the Paris Academy’s
annual competition and won first prize.</p>
<p>As a result of this award and the fame brought about by "Mathematical Exercises,"
Bernoulli was invited to accept the chair of mathematics at the Imperial
Academy in St. Petersburg by Catherine I of Russia, Peter the Great’s widow.
At the same time, his brother, Nicolaus, was offered a chair in mathematics at
St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>The brothers considered a game in which a coin is tossed "n" times until the
first "heads" appears. If you get a head for the first time on the nth toss, you
get 2n dollars. What amount of money would you be willing to pay to play this
game? Despite the fact that the expected value of the payoff is infinite as: </p>

    <p>Of course, no one appears to be willing to pay this amount to participate in this
game. So, Daniel Bernoulli’s solution to the paradox was to assume that utility
is strictly concave in the payoff rather than linear, e.g., ln (x). What particular
payoff, c, would an individual with such a utility function consider to be the St.
Petersburg lottery? This c would have to meet the following requirements:</p>

</center>
<p>As a result, c = 4 is a rather modest value to assign to the infinite expectation.
The St. Petersburg paradox arose as a result of this.</p>
<p>Nicolaus died just a few months after the brothers arrived in St. Petersburg, so
Johann Bernoulli arranged for his best student and Daniel Bernoulli’s childhood
friend, Leonhard Euler, to come and help him. Bernoulli’s most productive
years would be the next few years. He defined the simple nodes and frequencies
of a system’s oscillation while studying vibrating systems, and demonstrated
that the strings of musical instruments move in an infinite number of harmonic
vibrations all along the string.</p>
<p>Between 1725 and 1749, Daniel received ten prizes from the Paris Academy of
Sciences for his work in astronomy, gravity, tides, magnetism, ocean currents,
and ship behaviour. He also made significant contributions in probability.</p>
<p>Johann and Daniel’s relationship strained when they both competed for the
Grand Prix in 1734. Paris Academy Prize, a mathematical and physical sciences
school. They both prevailed, and the prospect of Johann was enraged because
he shared the prize with his own son. Daniel was barred from entering his home.</p>
<p>The relationship was strained further when Johann Bernoulli published "Hydraulica,"
a piece on hydrodynamics, in 1739, while Daniel published "Hydrodynamica,"
a very similar work, one year earlier. Johann blatantly plagiarised
"Hydrodynamica" in his publication of "Hydraulica," and even backdated it to
1732 to make it appear as if his work was first published. However, the plagiarism
was quickly discovered.</p>
<p>Daniel Bernoulli continued to work in calculus, mechanics, energy conservation,
oscillation, and the movement of bodies in a resisting medium in his later years.
He belonged to the Royal Society of London, the Paris Academy of Sciences, the
Berlin Academy, and the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Bernoulli died
on March 17, 1782, in Basel, just a few weeks before his eighty-second birthday</p>
